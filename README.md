# CodeRtsv Group Policies
Welcome to CodeRtsv, the JCU Townsville R user group! We are a group of semi, somewhat, and diehard R writing scientists who use R (and other languages) to solve a diverse set of problems in our respective fields. This group is really about sharing knowledge, helping others, and creating a collaborative environment for all; regardless of experience or background. In this repo you'll find some policies detailing our guiding philosophy and code of conduct. A core idea of this group is open source/open science, if there's something you don't agree or would like to change (e.g. typoes!) please submit a RP and we can improve together.

## Statement of Philosophy

> __*The Peter Parker principle*__

> *"With great power comes great responsability" Uncle Ben*

Researchers, technical personnel and students within government and public research institutions must ensure 
science is done under an ethical, reproducible, repeatable, and sounding framework. This can be achieved by
embracing and adopting open practices which encourage and promote these guiding principles. Open software, 
open science, and open data are enhancing and enabling collaborations, increasing the efficiency and reach
of research endeavors, and its dissemination to wider audiences. **codeRtsv** seeks to increase the 
scientific literacy in R, an open source and freeware programming language, and other information and 
communication technologies (ICT) among its members. We are confidence that by igniting and supporting a 
passion for learning the R programming language and other ICTs our members will be better equipped to increase
reproducible science, encourage research integrity, promote open advocacy, and train/help others in achieving
these goals. We believe knowledge has the power to change lives, therefore **codeRtsv** goal is to support 
capacity building of the current and next generation of scientist that can transform our world.

**codeRtsv** is composed and represented by people from diverse genders, backgrounds, cultures and disciplines.
We embrace and celebrate diversity in all its forms. **codeRtsv** is an space to learn and nurture a culture of
curiosity, collaboration, interchange of ideas, troubleshooting, and sharing knowledge.
